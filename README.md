# What is this?
This software is to allow for free, open, reliable biometric authentication for classical methods. This is built to 
match a password to a person typing it or a keycard to a person holding it.

This will be released as an API that can then be easily accessed for development of new
biometric techonologies to a fully open database to be used for authentication. This technology uses the face_recognition module
in python3 for deep learning facial recognition for your apps as well as the adafruit-fingerprint library for the fingerprint sensing for prototyping.

In the future we hope to use our API to implement a free mobile app for authentication all over the world for everyone paired with 
traditional authentication for free stong security.
